# Buddy Allocator
This code is the prototype for [Bolt](https://github.com/bolt-sys/bolt).
## Todo
- [X] Initialize the buddy allocator objects without using `malloc()`.
- [ ] Implement `buddy_alloc()` and `buddy_free()`.
## Bit Map
Maybe i implement it later. But for now, i decided to sacrifice some memory for readability.
